xxunk to survive , and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly xxunk their new - xxunk pseudo - philosophy . xxmaj basically , if you start your day off xxunk to the likes of xxmaj enya and xxmaj kenny g , this movie is for you . xxmaj if you have a sense of humor , a crowd of people who know how to have fun , and a sizable portion of good xxunk , then this movie is for you as well . xxmaj otherwise , stay away . xxmaj take my word for it . \\n \\n  xxmaj the first thing that struck me about \" xxmaj what the xxmaj bleep do you xxmaj know \" is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera , complete with pink heart effects , computer - xxunk xxunk across the screen , and other assorted silliness . xxmaj who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me . i guess this is what too much xxmaj kenny g does to you . xxmaj the movie was xxunk with cheesy xxup xxunk , the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via over - the - counter video editing software , but never would , because it \\'s just way too ridiculous . \\n \\n  xxmaj the script was _ obviously _ written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever . xxmaj not only were all the characters and conversations xxunk and contrived beyond belief , but the \" writers \" felt like they had to xxunk every relevant piece of information , or rather xxunk , which is what most of this movie was all about , all the way down your xxunk . xxmaj well , given the target audience , that may not have been too bad of an idea . xxmaj the main character , for example , spends half the movie popping pills . xxmaj apparently , though , it was deemed not convincing enough , so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout , which refer to her anti - anxiety pills specifically , just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down . xxmaj the acting ... xxmaj well , i \\'ve seen better acting in xxmaj ed xxmaj wood movies , and no , this is not an exaggeration . xxmaj heck , the little play i was in when i was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this . xxmaj it really did . \\n \\n  xxmaj the story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads , a strange mix of kooky scientists , kooky doctors , and self - proclaimed xxunk , go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an \" explanation \" for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life . xxmaj reality , you see , is a xxunk - field of a bunch of different possibilities , and is only set in stone once you the xxmaj observer chose to notice it . xxmaj what happens when more than one xxmaj observer xxmaj xxunk they did n\\'t say , but then again who cares . xxmaj listen to xxmaj enya , xxunk , xxmaj observe , and you shall be xxmaj god , and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking , logic , etc . xxmaj all reason is immediately xxunk as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a \" xxunk shift \" and \" go down the rabbit hole \" . xxmaj furthermore , the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities , parallel xxunk , and such . \\n \\n  xxmaj speaking of rabbit holes , the xxunk permeates the movie . xxmaj all of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes . i \\'m not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing , but one thing i \\'m certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex . xxmaj actually , the movie is _ extremely _ anti - sex . xxmaj throughout , sex is presented as dirty , ugly , and anti - enlightening . \\n \\n  xxmaj in any case , the talking heads talk , the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker , and proceeds to walk around with an even xxunk look in her xxunk over eyes than she started with . \\n \\n  i want 2 hours of my life back . \\n \\n  xxmaj here \\'s a couple of random xxunk which i happened to remember : \\n \\n  \" xxmaj what i think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me , and that , which i used to consider real , is xxunk a lot less real than the unreal . \" - xxmaj some talking head on the xxunk of quantum physics . \\n \\n  \" xxmaj what does it take for one man to have an erection ? xxmaj it takes just one thought . xxmaj nothing changes on the outside , all the changes are within . xxmaj an yet he has an erection \" - xxmaj some self proclaimed xxunk , head of her own school of enlightenment . \\n \\n  [ while looking at herself in the mirror ] \" i hate you ! i hate you ! xxmaj you \\'re fat ! xxmaj you \\'re ugly ! i have you ! \" - main character , the fat and ugly photographer .'"

       "  xxmaj second biggest complaint : these people are supposed to be forty - somethings , right ? xxmaj then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year - olds ? xxmaj is three weeks ( ie . three whole damn episodes ) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend does n't want to be your \" friend with benefits \" , it 's maybe not because he wants to hurt you , but because he does n't want to risk your friendship ? xxmaj the character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you ca n't really buy into the supposed \" drama \" . \n",
